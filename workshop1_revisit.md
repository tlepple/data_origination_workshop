# Apache Iceberg Introduction Workshop

---

## Objective:
My goal in this workshop was to evaluate Apache Iceberg with data stored in an S3a-compliant object store on a traditional Linux server.  The original workshop for this is here: [Intro to Iceberg Workshop](https://github.com/tlepple/iceberg-intro-workshop).   The items were added to this workshop for those that want to combine the work into one.   It has been modified sligthly from the original to avoid port conflicts.   Documentation here may need addtional updates.


---
---
###  What is Apache Iceberg:

Apache Iceberg is an open-source data management system for large-scale data lakes. It provides a table abstraction for big data workloads, allowing for schema evolution, data discovery and simplified data access. Iceberg uses Apache Avro, Parquet or ORC as its data format and supports various storage systems like HDFS, S3, ADLS, etc.

Iceberg uses a versioning approach to manage schema changes, enabling multiple versions of a schema to coexist in a table, providing the ability to perform schema evolution without the need for copying data. Additionally, Iceberg provides data discovery capabilities, allowing users to identify the data they need for their specific use case and extract only that data, reducing the amount of I/O required to perform a query.

Iceberg provides an easy-to-use API for querying data, supporting SQL and other query languages through Apache Spark, Hive, Presto and other engines. Icebergâ€™s table-centric design helps to manage large datasets with high scalability, reliability and performance.

---
---
### But Why Apache Iceberg:

A couple of items really jumped out at me when I read the documentation for the first time and I immediately saw the significant benefit it could provide.  Namely it could reduce the overall expense of enterprises to store and process the data they produce.  We all know that saving money in an enterprise is a good thing.

It can also perform standard `CRUD` operations on our tables seamlessly. Here are the two items that really hit home for me:

  ---
  ### Item 1:
  ---
  *  Iceberg is designed for huge tables and is used in production where a single table can contain tens of petabytes of data.  This data can be stored in modern-day object stores similar to these:
      *   A Cloud provider like [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc2=h_ql_prod_st_s3) 
      *   An on-premise solution that you build and support yourself like [Minio](https://min.io/).  
      *   Or a vendor hardware appliance like the [Dell ECS Enterprise Object Storage](https://www.dell.com/en-us/dt/storage/ecs/index.htm)
        
Regardless of which object store you choose, your overall expense to support this platform will see a significant savings over what you probably spend today.
  
  ---
  ### Item 2:
  ---
  *  Multi-petabyte tables can be read from a single node without needing a distributed SQL engine to sift through table metadata.  That means the tools used in the examples I give below could be used to query the data stored in object stores without needing to dedicate expensive compute servers.  You could spin up virtual instances or containers and execute queries against the data stored in the object store.

# Highlights:

---

This setup script built a single node platform that set up a local S3a compliant object store, install a local SQL database, install a single node Apache Iceberg processing engine and lay the groundwork for the support of our Apache Iceberg tables and catalog.   
 
  ---
####  Object Storage Notes:
  ---
  *  This type of object store could also be set up to run in your own data center if that is a requirement.   Otherwise, you could build and deploy something very similar in AWS using their S3 service instead.   I chose this option to demonstrate you have a lot of options you might not have considered.  It will store all of our Apache Iceberg data and catalog database objects.  
  *  This particular service is running Minio and it has a rest API that supports direct integration with the AWS CLI tool.  The script also installed the AWS CLI tools and configured the properties of the AWS CLI to work directly with Minio.

  ---
#### Local Database Notes:
  ---
  *  The local SQL database is PostgreSQL and it will host metadata with pointers to the Apache Iceberg table data persisted in our object store and the metadata for our Apache Iceberg catalog.  It maintains a very small footprint.
  
  ---
####  Apache Iceberg Processing Engine Notes:
  ---
  *  This particular workshop is using Apache Spark but we could have chosen any of the currently supported platforms.  We could also choose to use a combination of these tools and have them share the same Apache Iceberg Catalog.  Here is the current list of supported tools:  
     *  Spark
     *  Flink
     *  Trino
     *  Presto
     *  Dremio
     *  StarRocks
     *  Amazon Athena
     *  Amazon EMR
     *  Impala (Cloudera)
     *  Doris

### Testing the `AWS CLI` and the `Minio CLI`:

---
---

###  AWS CLI Integration:

Let's test out the AWS CLI that was installed and configured during the build and run an `AWS S3` command to list the buckets currently stored in our Minio object store.

---

##### Command:

```
aws --endpoint-url http://127.0.0.1:9000 s3 ls
```

##### Expected Output: The bucket name.
```
2023-01-24 22:58:38 iceberg-data
```
---

---

###  Minio CLI Integration:

There is also a minio rest API to accomplish many administrative tasks and use buckets without using AWS CLI. The minio client was also installed and configured during setup.  Here is a link to the documentation:  [Minio Client](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html).

---

##### List Command:

```
mc ls icebergadmin
```

##### Expected Output: The bucket name.
```
[2023-01-26 16:54:33 UTC]     0B iceberg-data/

```

---
---
###  Minio Overview:

Minio is an open-source, high-performance, and scalable object storage system. It is designed to be API-compatible with Amazon S3, allowing applications written for Amazon S3 to work seamlessly with Minio. Minio can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or in a hybrid environment, providing a unified, centralized repository for storing and managing unstructured data, such as images, videos, and backups.

Minio provides features such as versioning, access control, encryption, and event notifications, making it suitable for use cases such as data archiving, backup and disaster recovery, and media and entertainment. Minio also supports distributed mode, allowing multiple Minio nodes to be combined into a single object storage cluster for increased scalability and reliability.

Minio can be used with a variety of tools and frameworks, including popular cloud-native technologies like Kubernetes, Docker, and Ansible, making it easy to deploy and manage.

##  Apache Iceberg Processing Engine Setup:

---
In this section, we are configuring our processing engine (Apache Spark) that will use some of its tools to build our Apache Iceberg catalog and let us interact with the data we will load.

---

##### Start a standalone Spark Master Server 

```
cd $SPARK_HOME

. ./sbin/start-master.sh
```
---

##### Start a Spark Worker Server 

```
. ./sbin/start-worker.sh spark://$(hostname -f):7077
```
---

#####  Check that the Spark GUI is up:
 * navigate to `http//<host ip address>:8085` in a browser

---

##### Sample view of Spark Master.

---

![](./images/spark_master_view.png)

---

####  Configure the Spark-SQL service:
---
In this step, we will initialize some variables that will be used when we start the Spark-SQL service.  Copy this entire block and run in a terminal window.

```
. ~/minio-output.properties

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$secret_key
export AWS_S3_ENDPOINT=127.0.0.1:9000
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export MINIO_REGION=us-east-1
export DEPENDENCIES="org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-spark-runtime-3.3_2.12:1.1.0"
export AWS_SDK_VERSION=2.19.19
export AWS_MAVEN_GROUP=software.amazon.awssdk
export AWS_PACKAGES=(
"bundle"
"url-connection-client"
)
for pkg in "${AWS_PACKAGES[@]}"; do
export DEPENDENCIES+=",$AWS_MAVEN_GROUP:$pkg:$AWS_SDK_VERSION"
done
```

#####  Start the Spark-SQL client service:
---
Starting this service will connect to our PostgreSQL database and store database objects that point to the Apache Iceberg Catalog on our behalf.   The metadata for our catalog & tables (along with table records) will be stored in files persisted in our object stores.

```
cd $SPARK_HOME

###  Exercises:
In this lab, we will create our first iceberg table with `Spark-SQL`

---
---

#### Start the `Spark-SQL` cli tool
 * from the spark-sql console run the below commands:

---

##### Create Tables:
  * These will be run in the spark-sql cli
```
CREATE TABLE icecatalog.icecatalog.customer (
    first_name STRING,
    last_name STRING,
    street_address STRING,
    city STRING,
    state STRING,
    zip_code STRING,
    home_phone STRING,
    mobile STRING,
    email STRING,
    ssn STRING,
    job_title STRING,
    create_date STRING,
    cust_id BIGINT)
USING iceberg
OPTIONS (
    'write.object-storage.enabled'=true,
    'write.data.path'='s3://iceberg-data')
PARTITIONED BY (state);

CREATE TABLE icecatalog.icecatalog.transactions (
    transact_id STRING,
    transaction_date STRING,
    item_desc STRING,
    barcode STRING,
    category STRING,
    amount STRING,
    cust_id BIGINT)
USING iceberg
OPTIONS (
    'write.object-storage.enabled'=true,
    'write.data.path'='s3://iceberg-data');
```

---

###  Examine the bucket in Minio from the GUI
  * It wrote out all the metadata and files into our object storage from the Apache Iceberg Catalog we created.

---
![](./images/bucket_first_table_metadata_view.png)
---

####  Insert some records with our SparkSQL CLI:
  *  In this step we will load up some JSON records from a file created during setup.
  *  We will create a temporary view against this JSON file and then load the file with an INSERT statement.
---

##### Create temporary view statement:
```
CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW customerView
  USING org.apache.spark.sql.json
  OPTIONS (
    path "/opt/spark/input/customers.json"
  );
```

##### Query our temporary view with this statement:
```
SELECT cust_id, first_name, last_name FROM customerView;
```

##### Sample Output:
```
cust_id first_name      last_name
10      Brenda          Thompson
11      Jennifer        Anderson
12      William         Jefferson
13      Jack            Romero
14      Robert          Johnson
Time taken: 0.173 seconds, Fetched 5 row(s)

```

---
##### Query our customer table before we load data to it:
```
SELECT cust_id, first_name, last_name FROM icecatalog.icecatalog.customer;
```

##### Sample Output:

```
cust_id     first_name      last_name
Time taken: 0.111 seconds

```

##### Load the existing icegberg table (created earlier) with an `INSERT as SELECT` type of query:
```
INSERT INTO icecatalog.icecatalog.customer 
    SELECT 
             first_name, 
             last_name, 
             street_address, 
             city, 
             state, 
             zip_code, 
             home_phone,
             mobile,
             email,
             ssn,
             job_title,
             create_date,
             cust_id
    FROM customerView;

```

---
##### Query our customer table after we have loaded this JSON file:
```
SELECT cust_id, first_name, last_name FROM icecatalog.icecatalog.customer;
```

##### Sample Output:

```
cust_id first_name      last_name
10      Brenda          Thompson
11      Jennifer        Anderson
13      Jack            Romero
14      Robert          Johnson
12      William         Jefferson
Time taken: 0.262 seconds, Fetched 5 row(s)


```

---

### Now let's run a more advanced query:

Let's Add and Update some rows in one step with an example `MERGE` Statement.   This will create a view on top of a json file and then run our query to update existing rows if they match on the field `cust_id` and if they don't match on this field append the new rows to our `customer` table all in the same query.

---
##### Create temporary view statement:
```
CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW mergeCustomerView
  USING org.apache.spark.sql.json
  OPTIONS (
    path "/opt/spark/input/update_customers.json"
  );
```

##### Merge records from a json file:  
```
MERGE INTO icecatalog.icecatalog.customer c
USING (SELECT
             first_name,
             last_name,
             street_address,
             city,
             state,
             zip_code,
             home_phone,
             mobile,
             email,
             ssn,
             job_title,
             create_date,
             cust_id
       FROM mergeCustomerView) j
ON c.cust_id = j.cust_id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET
             c.first_name = j.first_name,
             c.last_name = j.last_name,
             c.street_address = j.street_address,
             c.city = j.city,
             c.state = j.state,
             c.zip_code = j.zip_code,
             c.home_phone = j.home_phone,
             c.mobile = j.mobile,
             c.email = j.email,
             c.ssn = j.ssn,
             c.job_title = j.job_title,
             c.create_date = j.create_date
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *;
```
---

---
##### Query our customer table after running our merge query:
```
SELECT cust_id, first_name, last_name FROM icecatalog.icecatalog.customer ORDER BY cust_id;
```

##### Sample Output:

```
cust_id first_name      last_name
10      Caitlyn         Rogers
11      Brittany        Williams
12      Victor          Gordon
13      Shelby          Martinez
14      Corey           Bridges
15      Benjamin        Rocha
16      Jonathan        Lawrence
17      Thomas          Taylor
18      Jeffrey         Williamson
19      Joseph          Mccullough
20      Evan            Kirby
21      Teresa          Pittman
22      Alicia          Byrd
23      Kathleen        Ellis
24      Tony            Lee
Time taken: 0.381 seconds, Fetched 15 row(s)

```
*  Note that the values for customers with `cust_id` between 10-14 have new updated information.

### Explore Time Travel with Apache Iceberg:

---
So far in our workshop we have loaded some tables and run some `CRUD` operations with our platform.  In this exercise, we are going to see a really cool feature called `Time Travel`.

Time travel queries refer to the ability to query data as it existed at a specific point in time in the past. This feature is useful in a variety of scenarios, such as auditing, disaster recovery, and debugging.

In a database or data warehousing system with time travel capability, historical data is stored along with a timestamp, allowing users to query the data as it existed at a specific time. This is achieved by either using a separate historical store or by maintaining multiple versions of the data in the same store.

Time travel queries are typically implemented using tools like snapshots, temporal tables, or versioned data stores. These tools allow users to roll back to a previous version of the data and access it as if it were the current version. Time travel queries can also be combined with other data management features, such as data compression, data partitioning, and indexing, to improve performance and make historical data more easily accessible.

In order to run a time travel query we need some metadata to pass into our query.  The metadata exists in our catalog and it can be accessed with a query.  The following query will return some metadata from our database.

  *  your results will be slightly different.
    
##### Query from SparkSQL CLI:
```
SELECT 
     committed_at, 
     snapshot_id, 
     parent_id 
  FROM icecatalog.icecatalog.customer.snapshots
  ORDER BY committed_at;
```
---

#### Expected Output:

```
committed_at            snapshot_id             parent_id
2023-01-26 16:58:31.873 2216914164877191507     NULL
2023-01-26 17:00:18.585 3276759594719593733     2216914164877191507
Time taken: 0.195 seconds, Fetched 2 row(s)
```

###  `Time Travel` example from data in our customer table:

When we loaded our `customer` table initially it had only 5 rows of data.  We then ran a `MERGE` query to update some existing rows and insert new rows. With this query, we can see our table results as they existed in that initial phase before the `MERGE`.

We need to grab the `snapshop_id` value from our above query and edit the following query with your `snapshot_id` value.

The query of the table after our first INSERT statement:
  *  replace this `snapshop_id` with your value:

In this step, we will get results that show the data as it was originally loaded.
```
SELECT
    cust_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    create_date

###  Example from data in our customer table after running our `MERGE` statement:

In this step, we will see sample results from our customer table after we ran the `MERGE` step earlier.  It will show the updated existing rows and our new rows. 
  *  remember to replace `<your snapshot_id here>`  with the `snapshop_id` from your table metadata.  

##### Query:
```
SELECT
    cust_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    create_date
  FROM icecatalog.icecatalog.customer

 VERSION AS OF <your snapshot_id here>
 ORDER by cust_id;
```

### Exit out of `sparksql` cli.

```
exit;

```

### Explore Iceberg operations using Spark Dataframes.

We will use `pyspark` in this example and load our `Transactions` table with a pyspark dataFrame.

##### Notes:
  * pyspark isn't as feature-rich as the sparksql client (in future versions it should catch up).  For example, it doesn't support the `MERGE` example we tested earlier.

---

###  Start `pyspark` cli
  *  run this in a terminal window
```
cd $SPARK_HOME
pyspark
```

##### Query:
```
SELECT 
   c.cust_id
   , c.first_name
   , c.last_name
   , t.transact_id
   , t.item_desc
   , t.amount
FROM 
   icecatalog.icecatalog.customer c
   , icecatalog.icecatalog.transactions t
INNER JOIN icecatalog.icecatalog.customer cj ON  c.cust_id = t.cust_id
LIMIT 20;
```

## Summary:

---
Using Apache Spark with Apache Iceberg can provide many benefits for big data processing and data lake management. Apache Spark is a fast and flexible data processing engine that can be used for a variety of big data use cases, such as batch processing, streaming, and machine learning. By integrating with Apache Iceberg, Spark can leverage Iceberg's table abstraction, versioning capabilities, and data discovery features to manage large-scale data lakes with increased efficiency, reliability, and scalability.

Using Apache Spark with Apache Iceberg allows organizations to leverage the benefits of Spark's distributed processing capabilities, while at the same time reducing the complexity of managing large-scale data lakes. Additionally, the integration of Spark and Iceberg provides the ability to perform complex data processing operations while still providing data management capabilities such as schema evolution, versioning, and data discovery.

Finally, as both Spark and Iceberg are open-source projects, organizations can benefit from a large and active community of developers who are contributing to the development of these technologies. This makes it easier for organizations to adopt and use these tools, and to quickly resolve any issues that may arise.

---
#### Final Thoughts:
---
 
In a series of upcoming workshops, I will build out and document some new technologies that can be integrated with legacy solutions deployed by most organizations today.  It will give you a roadmap into how you can gain insights (in near real-time) from data produced in your legacy systems with minimal impact on those servers.  We will use a Change Data Capture (CDC) approach to pull the data from log files produced by the database providers and deliver it to our Apache Iceberg solution we built today.

If you have made it this far, I want to thank you for spending your time reviewing the materials. Please give me a 'Star' at the top of this page if you found it useful.
